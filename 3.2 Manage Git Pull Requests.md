Max want to push some new changes to one of the repositories but we don't want people to push directly to master branch, since that would be the final version of the code. It should always only have content that has been reviewed and approved. We cannot just allow everyone to directly push to the master branch. So, let's do it the right way as discussed below:


SSH into storage server using user max, password Max_pass123 . There you can find an already cloned repo under Max user's home.


Max has written his story about The ü¶ä Fox and Grapes üçá


Max has already pushed his story to remote git repository hosted on Gitea branch story/fox-and-grapes


Check the contents of the cloned repository. Confirm that you can see Sarah's story and history of commits by running git log and validate author info, commit message etc.


Max has pushed his story, but his story is still not in the master branch. Let's create a Pull Request(PR) to merge Max's story/fox-and-grapes branch into the master branch


Click on the Gitea UI button on the top bar. You should be able to access the Gitea page.


UI login info:

- Username: max

- Password: Max_pass123

PR title : Added fox-and-grapes story

PR pull from branch: story/fox-and-grapes (source)

PR merge into branch: master (destination)


Before we can add our story to the master branch, it has to be reviewed. So, let's ask tom to review our PR by assigning him as a reviewer


Add tom as reviewer through the Git Portal UI

Go to the newly created PR

Click on Reviewers on the right

Add tom as a reviewer to the PR

Now let's review and approve the PR as user Tom


Login to the portal with the user tom


Logout of Git Portal UI if logged in as max


UI login info:

- Username: tom

- Password: Tom_pass123

PR title : Added fox-and-grapes story

Review and merge it.

Great stuff!! The story has been merged! üëè

I'm sorry for any confusion, but currently, I can't interact with external interfaces, websites, or execute commands in a specific environment. I can provide guidance on how to perform the tasks you've described using Git and Gitea.

1. **SSH into the storage server:**
   ```
   ssh max@storage-server
   ```

2. **Check the contents of the cloned repository:**
   ```
   cd ~/repository-folder
   git log
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Push your changes to the remote repository first.
   ```
   git push origin story/fox-and-grapes
   ```
   - Then, create the PR through the Gitea UI as described, selecting `story/fox-and-grapes` as the source branch and `master` as the destination branch.

4. **Add Tom as a reviewer:**
   - In the Gitea UI, navigate to the newly created PR.
   - Click on "Reviewers" on the right.
   - Add Tom as a reviewer.

5. **Login as Tom and review the PR:**
   - Logout of Gitea if you are still logged in as Max.
   - Log in as Tom using the provided credentials.
   - Go to the PR and review it.
   - If everything looks good, merge the PR.

Please note that these are generic instructions, and you need to adapt them to your specific environment. If you face any issues or have specific questions, feel free to ask for further clarification. Additionally, you may want to use screenshot or recording tools to document your progress.

Certainly! To create a Pull Request (PR) to merge Max's `story/fox-and-grapes` branch into the `master` branch, you can follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the local repository:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/repository-folder
   ```

2. **Push the changes to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin story/fox-and-grapes
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request through the Gitea UI:**
   - Open your web browser and go to the Gitea UI.
   - Log in with the provided credentials for Max.
   - Navigate to the repository and switch to the "Pull Requests" section.

4. **Create a new Pull Request:**
   - Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
   - Set the "Pull from branch" to `story/fox-and-grapes` (source branch).
   - Set the "Merge into branch" to `master` (destination branch).
   - Provide a title for the PR, such as "Added fox-and-grapes story."
   - Click on the "Create Pull Request" button.
