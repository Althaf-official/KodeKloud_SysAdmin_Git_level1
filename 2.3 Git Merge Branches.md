The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/beta.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:



## Create a new branch devops in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.

    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

Certainly! Let's break down the steps to create a new branch named `devops` in the `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta` repository from the `master` branch, copy the `/tmp/index.html` file into the repository, add/commit the file in the new branch, merge the `devops` branch into the `master` branch, and push the changes to the origin for both branches:

1. **Navigate to the Git repository:**

   ```bash
   cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta
   ```

2. **Create and switch to the new branch 'devops' from 'master':**

   ```bash
   git checkout master  # Ensure you are on the master branch
   git pull origin master  # Pull any changes to master
   git checkout -b devops
   ```

3. **Copy `/tmp/index.html` into the repository:**

   Assuming that `/tmp/index.html` is the file you want to copy:

   ```bash
   cp /tmp/index.html .
   ```

4. **Add and commit the file in the new branch:**

   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add index.html to devops branch"
   ```

5. **Merge 'devops' branch into 'master':**

   ```bash
   git checkout master  # Switch to the master branch
   git merge devops     # Merge devops branch into master
   ```

   Resolve any merge conflicts if necessary. After resolving conflicts, continue with the merge.

6. **Push changes to the origin for both branches:**

   ```bash
   git push origin devops  # Push the devops branch
   git push origin master  # Push the master branch
   ```

Now, you have successfully created a new branch named `devops` from the `master` branch, copied the `/tmp/index.html` file into the repository, added/committed the file in the `devops` branch, merged the changes back into the `master` branch, and pushed the changes to the origin for both branches in the `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta` repository.
