Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:



## On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch xfusioncorp_cluster from master branch in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster git repo.


#### Please do not try to make any changes in the code.

To create a new branch named `xfusioncorp_cluster` from the `master` branch in the `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster` Git repository on your storage server in the Stratos DC, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Git repository:**

   ```bash
   cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster
   ```

2. **Update the local `master` branch:**

   Ensure that your local `master` branch is up-to-date with the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```

3. **Create and switch to the new branch:**

   Create a new branch named `xfusioncorp_cluster` and switch to it:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b xfusioncorp_cluster
   ```

   This command creates a new branch (`xfusioncorp_cluster`) and switches to it.

Create a new branch:


`git checkout -b <new_branch>` This command creates a new branch named <new_branch> and switches to it. 
If you want to create the branch without switching to it immediately, you can use:`git branch <new_branch>`



4. **Verify the new branch:**

   You can verify that you are now on the new branch by running:

   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

   The output should show a list of branches, with an asterisk (*) next to the currently active branch (which should be `xfusioncorp_cluster`).

5. **(Optional) Push the new branch to the remote repository:**

   If you want to make the new branch available on the remote repository, you can push it using:

   ```bash
   git push origin xfusioncorp_cluster
   ```

   This step assumes that you have the necessary permissions to push branches to the remote repository.

Now you have successfully created a new branch named `xfusioncorp_cluster` from the `master` branch in the `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster` Git repository on your storage server in the Stratos DC. You can start working on the `xfusioncorp_cluster` branch, and if needed, push the changes to the remote repository.
