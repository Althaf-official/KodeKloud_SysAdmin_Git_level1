A new developer just joined the Nautilus development team and has been assigned a new project for which he needs to create a new repository under his account on Gitea server. Additionally, there is some existing data that need to be added to the repo. Below you can find more details about the task:


Click on the Gitea UI button on the top bar. You should be able to access the Gitea UI. Login to Gitea server using username max and password Max_pass123.


a. Create a new git repository story_ecommerce under max user.


b. SSH into storage server using user max and password Max_pass123 and clone this newly created repository under user max home directory i.e /home/max.


c. Copy all files from location /usr/security to the repository and commit/push your changes to the master branch. The commit message must be "add stories" (must be done in single commit).


d. Create a new branch max_demo from master.


e. Copy a file story-index-max.txt from location /tmp/stories/ to the repository. This file has a typo, which you can fix by changing the word Mooose to Mouse. Commit and push the changes to the newly created branch. Commit message must be "typo fixed for Mooose" (must be done in single commit).


Note: For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.

I'm sorry for any confusion, but as a text-based AI developed by OpenAI, I can't interact with graphical user interfaces, take screenshots, or perform actions on external systems like Gitea servers. However, I can guide you through the steps you need to take to complete the tasks you've described. 

Here's a set of commands you could use to accomplish the tasks you've outlined. Please note that this assumes you have the necessary permissions and access to perform these actions.

### a. Create a new git repository story_ecommerce under max user.

```bash
# Use Gitea UI to create a new repository under max user (story_ecommerce)

```

### b. SSH into storage server using user max and password Max_pass123 and clone this newly created repository under user max home directory i.e /home/max.

```bash
ssh max@storage_server
# Enter Max_pass123 when prompted
cd /home/max
git clone http://your-gitea-server.com/max/story_ecommerce.git
```

### c. Copy all files from location /usr/security to the repository and commit/push your changes to the master branch. The commit message must be "add stories" (must be done in a single commit).

```bash
cd story_ecommerce
cp -r /usr/security/* .
git add .
git commit -m "add stories"
git push origin master
```

### d. Create a new branch max_demo from master.

```bash
git checkout -b max_demo
```

### e. Copy a file story-index-max.txt from location /tmp/stories/ to the repository. This file has a typo, which you can fix by changing the word Mooose to Mouse. Commit and push the changes to the newly created branch. Commit message must be "typo fixed for Mooose" (must be done in a single commit).

```bash
cp /tmp/stories/story-index-max.txt .
sed -i 's/Mooose/Mouse/g' story-index-max.txt
git add story-index-max.txt
git commit -m "typo fixed for Mooose"
git push origin max_demo
```

Please replace `http://your-gitea-server.com` with the actual URL of your Gitea server.

Remember to replace placeholder values with actual values, and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions. If you encounter any issues or have additional requirements, feel free to ask for clarification.
