The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo present on Storage server in Stratos DC. This was just a test repository and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message add data.txt file. Find below more details:



### In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file.


Also make sure to push your changes.

To achieve this, you can use the following steps to reset the git commit history in the specified repository. Make sure to replace the `<commit-hash>` with the actual commit hash of the "add data.txt file" commit:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository directory
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo

# Perform a hard reset to the specified commit (add data.txt file)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Force push to update the remote repository
git push -f origin master
```

Explanation of the commands:

1. `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`: This command will reset the current branch (master) to the specified commit, discarding all changes after that commit. It will effectively remove the unwanted commits and changes.

2. `git push -f origin master`: This command will force push the changes to the remote repository on the Storage server. The `-f` flag is used to force the push because we have modified the commit history, and a regular push would be rejected.

Make sure to communicate with the team about the force push, as it overwrites the remote branch's history, and other developers who have cloned the repository should be aware of the change.
