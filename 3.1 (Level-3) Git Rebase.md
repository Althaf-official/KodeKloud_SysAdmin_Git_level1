The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/news.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:



### One of the developers is working on feature branch and their work is still in progress, however there are some changes which have been pushed into the master branch, the developer now wants to rebase the feature branch with the master branch without loosing any data from the feature branch, also they don't want to add any merge commit by simply merging the master branch into the feature branch. Accomplish this task as per requirements mentioned.


Also remember to push your changes once done.

To accomplish the task described, the developer needs to follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```

2. **Fetch the Latest Changes from the Master Branch:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin master
   ```

3. **Rebase the Feature Branch with the Master Branch:**
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/master
   ```

   During the rebase process, Git will apply the changes from the feature branch on top of the latest changes from the master branch. If there are any conflicts, Git will pause and ask the developer to resolve them.

4. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   If there are conflicts, Git will mark the conflicted files. The developer needs to manually resolve the conflicts, then continue the rebase using the following commands:
   ```bash
   git add <conflicted_files>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

   Repeat this process until the rebase is complete.

5. **Push the Changes to the Feature Branch:**
   After the rebase is successful, push the changes to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

   This will update the remote feature branch with the rebased changes.

By following these steps, the developer can rebase the feature branch with the master branch, incorporating the latest changes from the master branch into the feature branch without creating any merge commits.

The error message you're seeing indicates that your local feature branch is behind its remote counterpart (on the 'origin' remote repository). To resolve this, you need to incorporate the changes from the remote feature branch into your local branch before pushing again. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Fetch the Changes:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin feature
   ```

   This command fetches the changes from the remote feature branch but doesn't apply them to your local branch yet.

2. **Rebase Your Local Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/feature
   ```

   This command applies your local changes on top of the changes fetched from the remote feature branch. If there are any conflicts, Git will ask you to resolve them.

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   If there are conflicts, Git will pause the rebase process and ask you to resolve them. Use `git status` to see which files have conflicts, manually edit them to resolve the conflicts, and then use `git add <file>` to mark them as resolved. Finally, continue the rebase with:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

   Repeat these steps until the rebase is complete.

4. **Push the Changes Again:**
   Once the rebase is complete, you can push your changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature
   ```

   If you've successfully rebased and resolved conflicts, this push should go through without any issues.

By following these steps, you'll incorporate the changes from the remote feature branch into your local branch, resolve any conflicts that may arise, and then push the updated changes to the remote repository.
