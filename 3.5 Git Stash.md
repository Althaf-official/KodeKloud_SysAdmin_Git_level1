The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster present on Storage server in Stratos DC. One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository, but now they want to restore some of the stashed changes. Find below more details to accomplish this task:



Look for the stashed changes under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster git repository, and restore the stash with stash@{1} identifier. Further, commit and push your changes to the origin.

```To restore stashed changes with the identifier `stash@{1}` in the Git repository located at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster`, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on the Storage server in the Stratos DC.

2. Navigate to the Git repository:

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster
```

3. List the stashed changes to identify the correct stash you want to restore:

```bash
git stash list
```

Look for the stash with the identifier `stash@{1}`.

4. Restore the stash with the specified identifier:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

If you want to apply and remove the stash from the stash list, you can use:

```bash
git stash pop stash@{1}
```

5. After applying the stash, you may need to resolve any conflicts that arise.

6. Once you have resolved any conflicts, commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Restored stashed changes with stash@{1}"
```

7. Push the changes to the origin:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to push the changes to.

Now, the stashed changes with the identifier `stash@{1}` have been restored, committed, and pushed to the origin. Make sure to replace `<branch-name>` with the appropriate branch name where you want to apply the changes.
