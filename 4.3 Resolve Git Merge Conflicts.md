Sarah and Max were working on writting some stories which they have pushed to the repository. Max has recently added some new changes and is trying to push them to the repository but he is facing some issues. Below you can find more details:


SSH into storage server using user max and password Max_pass123. Under /home/max you will find the story-blog repository. Try to push the changes to the origin repo and fix the issues. The story-index.txt must have titles for all 4 stories. Additionally, there is a typo in The Lion and the Mooose line where Mooose should be Mouse.


Click on the Gitea UI button on the top bar. You should be able to access the Gitea page. You can login to Gitea server from UI using username sarah and password Sarah_pass123 or username max and password Max_pass123.


Note: For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.

      THE LION AND THE MOUSE
--------------------------------------------

A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws.

A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose.

Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.

"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."

The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.

Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net.

Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring.

The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net.

Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.

"You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion."max (master)$ cat frogs-and-ox.txt

      THE FROGS AND THE OX
--------------------------------------------

An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud.

The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.

"A great big monster," said one of them, "stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!"

"Big, was he!" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. "Was he as big as this?"

"Oh, much bigger!" they cried.

The Frog puffed up still more.

"He could not have been bigger than this," she said.

But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst.max (master)$ ls

      THE FOX AND GRAPES
--------------------------------------------

A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree.

The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.

The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it.

The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way.

So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more.

Again and again he tried, but in vain.

Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.

"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."

And off he walked very, very scornfully.max (master)$ cat story-index.txt

It looks like there is a merge conflict in the `story-index.txt` file. This happens when both Max and the remote repository have made changes to the same part of the file.

Here's what Max can do to resolve the merge conflict:

1. Open the `story-index.txt` file in a text editor. Inside the file, Git will mark the conflicting changes, and Max needs to manually resolve them.

2. Look for sections like this:

   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Max's changes
   =======
   Remote changes
   >>>>>>> a1b0c55
   ```

   The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` represents Max's local changes, and the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> a1b0c55` represents the changes from the remote repository.

3. Manually edit the file to incorporate the changes. Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> a1b0c55`) and make sure the content reflects the desired combination of Max's changes and the remote changes.

4. After resolving the conflict, save the file.

5. Add the resolved file to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add story-index.txt
   ```

6. Commit the changes to complete the merge:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in story-index.txt"
   ```

7. Finally, push the changes to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

Now, Max has successfully resolved the merge conflict and pushed the changes to the remote repository. If there are multiple conflicted files, repeat these steps for each file.
