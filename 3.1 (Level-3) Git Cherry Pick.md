The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/beta.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with the DevOps team:



There are two branches in this repository, master and feature. One of the developers is working on the feature branch and their work is still in progress, however they want to merge one of the commits from the feature branch to the master branch, the message for the commit that needs to be merged into master is Update info.txt. Accomplish this task for them, also remember to push your changes eventually.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

To accomplish this task, you can follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Repository:**
   ```bash
   cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta
   ```

2. **Checkout the Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature
   ```

3. **Identify the Commit Hash:**
   List the commits and find the commit hash for the "Update info.txt" commit.
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

4. **Switch to the Master Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

5. **Merge the Specific Commit from Feature to Master:**
   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual commit hash.
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```

   If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue with the cherry-pick process.

6. **Push Changes to Master Branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

Now, the specified commit from the feature branch has been merged into the master branch, and the changes have been pushed to the remote repository. Ensure that the developer is aware of these changes and the potential impact on their ongoing work in the feature branch.
