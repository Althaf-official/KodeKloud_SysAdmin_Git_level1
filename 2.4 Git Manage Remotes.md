The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/apps.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps. Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repository as per details mentioned below:


## a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repo add a new remote dev_apps and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git repository.


## b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.


## c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.

To accomplish the tasks you've outlined, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Task (a): Add a new remote 'dev_apps' and point it to the repository
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
git remote add dev_apps /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git

# Task (b): Copy the /tmp/index.html file to the repo and commit to master branch
cp /tmp/index.html .
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add index.html file"

# Task (c): Push master branch to the new remote origin 'dev_apps'
git push dev_apps master
```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations, and replace `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` and `/opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git` with the actual paths in your environment. Additionally, make sure that the index.html file exists in /tmp before attempting the copy operation.
